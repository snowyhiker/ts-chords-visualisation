# ts-chords-visualisation
Exploring Taylor Swift's complete discography by analysing the chord patterns she uses in her songs through a fun interactive dashboard.

Built using streamlit, plotly, and CSV based music data sourced from youtube, music blogs, chordify and other publicly available data on the internet. These chords are accurate best to my knowledge, but I cannot guarantee its accuracy 100%. If you think there are some inaccuracies that need to be changed, please feel free to contribute to this repo. Deployed using streamlit cloud.

For this project, I have considered her 12 studio album releases for my analysis. This does not include her re-releases (Taylor's Version) albums, but from the vault tracks have been added to the dataset. No other singles, or artist collaborations are included in the dataset.

### Run locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Made by a bored swiftie with too much time on her hands :)
